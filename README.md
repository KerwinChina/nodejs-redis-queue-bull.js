# Node.js Redis Queue with Bull.js

This project demonstrates how to implement a robust queue system using Bull.js in a Node.js application, 
leveraging Redis as the queue storage mechanism. Bull.js is a feature-rich library that facilitates handling distributed tasks,
background processing, and job scheduling in a Node.js environment, backed by the power of Redis.

## Features

- Efficient job processing with Redis.
- Scalable and distributed task management.
- Delayed job execution.
- Job prioritization and retries.
- Comprehensive job event monitoring.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Redis server

### Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment running:

1. **Clone the repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/KerwinChina/nodejs-redis-queue-bull.js.git
cd nodejs-redis-queue-bull.js
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```sh
npm install
```

3. **Start the Redis server**

Ensure your Redis server is running. Refer to the Redis documentation for starting Redis based on your operating system.

4. **Start the application**

```sh
npm start
```

## Usage

This section should describe how to use the application, including any available commands or API endpoints for adding jobs to the queue, processing them, etc.

## Running Tests

Explain how to run automated tests for this project (if applicable).

```sh
npm test
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes on how to deploy this project on a live system.
